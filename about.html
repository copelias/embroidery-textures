        <strong>MAACAT Cuisine</strong> is an experimental creative tool developed as part of the
        <strong>MAACAT</strong> project.
      </p>

      <p>
        The idea behind MAACAT Cuisine is simple: allow anyone to transform images using
        creative visual effects directly in the browser, without uploading files or relying
        on external servers.
      </p>

      <h2>How it works</h2>

      <p>
        All image processing happens locally on your device using JavaScript and HTML canvas.
        Your images are never uploaded, stored, or shared.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Upload an image from your device</li>
        <li>Select a creative effect</li>
        <li>Preview the result instantly</li>
        <li>Download the transformed image</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        MAACAT Cuisine is designed for experimentation, inspiration, and creative play.
        New effects are added over time as the project evolves.
      </p>

      <p>
        This tool is part of the broader MAACAT ecosystem, focused on creativity, learning,
        and digital experimentation.
